The Pixels of Minecraft is a mod that is designed to
be able to make everything out of thin air using
things that are technically able to be done in the
real world, with a litle bit of a minecraft twist.
<NEWLINE>
It aims to explain the nature of how minecraft
works, at least, that is how the players inside
the game see it.
This included explaining the laws of minecraft
and trying to explain the entirety of how mods
work.
