When an object on the entity grid gets correctly aligned with the block grid and a big enough outwards force is applied, the object can hop from the entity grid to the block grid and will fit itself to the correct size.

In the same way you can apply a semi constant force to a block to make it hop to the entity grid, in this proces there is a big chance that the block broken is damaged resulting in a conversion like stone to cobblestone.

It is thought that there is a way to move blocks from the block grid without letting it hop to the entity grid, if this is possible it will need a very strong force to keep the block into place.
